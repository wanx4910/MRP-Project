# MRP-Project
NSDUH project


This was my Master's thesis project. 
I used the NSUDH survey data to analyze the effect of having Medical Marijuana legalization policy 
on people's likelihood of using marijuana and the impact on the behaviour of marijuana users. I used
Linear Probability Models (LPM) to estimate the effect of socioeconomic variables such as education, household
income, legal regime, age, gender, ethnicity on the probablity that someone would use marijuana. I also
used Finite Mixture Model (FMM) to estimate the effect of the same socioeconomic variables on cannabis use 
intensity given that they used cannabis. FMM was used because it was assumed that there are two distinct groups
that generate the distribution shown in graph.png.
